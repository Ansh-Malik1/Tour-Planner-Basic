# Tour-Planner-Basic
This is like a basic 'Tour Planner' website with less functionality. It is made only to practice React's concepts. Many cities' cards are displayed on the UI and user can view its description by clicking 'Read More'. Also, the user can click 'Not Interested' button and the tour will be deleted.
